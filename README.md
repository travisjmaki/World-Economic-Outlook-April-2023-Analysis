This repository explores data from the IMFs annual report using the Notable plug-in on ChatGPT4


Hey there, good people. 
The surface-level goal of this project is to determine if there is any sort of relationship between a country's unemployment rate and its net government debt. 
However, the TRUE goal of this project is to explore the possibilities of natural language data analytics. 

A little backstory...
So Im sure by now you've probably heard about ChatGTP - it would honestly be impressive if you havent, at this point. 
About two months ago, ChatGPT released 'plug-ins' that allow users to integrate ChatGPT to other websites and applications (for some reason, TripAdvisor and InstaCart are popular plug-in examples).
Onep plug-in that caught my attention was Notable - a collaborative notebook platform to combine code (SQL, Python, & R), and interactive data visualizations.
ChatGPT is an increidble tool that has taken the world by storm. If it can use Noteable for natural language data processing, I believe everyone will be empowered to use data to formulate their thoughts and conclusions
without bias, and more importantly, be able to use data to better undestand the world. 
 
This project is a live test-run of the Noteable plug-in to determine its strengths, weaknesses, limits, and potential - hope you enjoy!
