The first prompt enterd into ChatGPT + Noteable was: 

_"Load this dataset: https://github.com/travisjmaki/World-Economic-Outlook-April-2023-Analysis/blob/main/World%20Economic%20Outlook%20April%202023.csv
Use this as my default project: https://app.noteable.io/p/7184f33b-8153-4f67-a950-5d8e6aafd5b0/Testing-Playspace
Use the Noteable plug-in. Act as a data scientist and analyze the dataset and make charts and graphs to show the major trends in unemployment and general government net debt around the world."_

As you can see, I first had to upload the IMF's data to GitHub. Then, using Noteable, I created a project space for the plug-in to work its magic. And this is what the project created:
_
"I have set your default project to "Testing-Playspace". Now, let's load the dataset from the provided URL.

To load the dataset, we will create a new notebook in your default project and write some Python code to download the CSV file from the GitHub repository. Let's start by creating a new notebook.

I've created a new notebook named "World_Economic_Outlook_Analysis.ipynb". You can follow along with the analysis here.

Now, let's create a code cell in the notebook to download the dataset from the provided URL.

It appears that there was an error while trying to load the dataset. The error message suggests that the file may not be in the UTF-8 encoding.

Let's try loading the data again, but this time we'll specify a different encoding. The 'ISO-8859-1' encoding (also known as 'latin1') is a common encoding for CSV files that can handle a wider range of characters than UTF-8. Let's try that.

The dataset has been successfully loaded. Here are the first few rows:

Country	Subject Descriptor	Units	Scale	2023
0	Afghanistan	Gross domestic product, constant prices	Percent change	nan	2.9
1	Afghanistan	Gross domestic product, current prices	U.S. dollars	Billions	22.269
2	Afghanistan	Gross domestic product, current prices	National currency	Billions	1756.42
3	Afghanistan	Gross domestic product per capita, current prices	U.S. dollars	Units	546.006
4	Afghanistan	Gross domestic product per capita, current prices	National currency	Units	43257.8
Now, let's start analyzing the data. We are interested in the trends in unemployment and general government net debt around the world. Let's first check the unique values in the 'Subject Descriptor' column to see if these metrics are present in the dataset.

The 'Subject Descriptor' column contains the following unique values:

Gross domestic product, constant prices
Gross domestic product, current prices
Gross domestic product, deflator
Gross domestic product per capita, constant prices
Gross domestic product per capita, current prices
Output gap in percent of potential GDP
Gross domestic product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) share of world total
Implied PPP conversion rate
Total investment
Gross national savings
Inflation, average consumer prices
Inflation, end of period consumer prices
Volume of imports of goods and services
Volume of Imports of goods
Volume of exports of goods and services
Volume of exports of goods
Unemployment rate
Employment
Population
General government revenue
General government total expenditure
General government net lending/borrowing
General government structural balance
General government primary net lending/borrowing
General government net debt
General government gross debt
Gross domestic product corresponding to fiscal year, current prices
Current account balance
From this list, we can see that 'Unemployment rate' and 'General government net debt' are present. Let's proceed with the analysis of these two metrics.

First, let's create a subset of the data that contains only the rows related to unemployment rate and general government net debt. Then, we'll visualize the data to identify major trends."_
